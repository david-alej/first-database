/*
Optimizing database by using indexes and normalizing 
*/

-- Starting with normalizing I believe my database is fully normalized except for maybe
-- creating anther table named address to house the church's address's but it is going
-- to be exceptionally rare that two churches are in the same address like an appartment
-- so its not worth it.

-- Next indexes here I decide to put an index on churches.name so that it is quicker to 
-- search for but I will not make it a cluster since there are going to be many churches I didn't 
-- add. So making this cluster is not worth it because I will need to recluster it after every update.

-- Creating the index on churches.name
CREATE INDEX churches_name_idx ON churches ( name);
